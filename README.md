## PyDeflektor
#### What is PyDeflektor?
PyDeflektor is my first-ever bigger programming project. It was made in 2021 as a semester project for a Programming class on my university. The challenge was to make an application in Python and I decided to create a game using [`pygame`](https://www.pygame.org/docs/). As part of the project, I also created documentation (both technical and user), but it is only available in Czech. 

#### What is the game about?
The game has two main objects - laser and mirrors. The goal is to rotate the mirrors the correct way in order for the laser to reach the target in a limited time frame. 

Once the laser reaches the target, the level is completed. There are 3 levels.

#### How to play?
- To start the application you have to run `PyDeflektor/main.py` using Python. Once the application is running, the game can be started by pressing `Enter`.
- To rotate the mirrors, you have to select them by clicking on them and then using `Q` and `E` to rotate the mirrors counter clockwise and clockwise respectively.
- To restart the level, press `R`.
- You can exit the game by pressing `Escape`.
